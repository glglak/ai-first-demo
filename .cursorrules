## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES FOR AI-ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT

1. **ACCURACY FIRST**: Document only what we actually implement
2. **HOURLY ITERATIONS**: Make changes in 1-3 hour focused sprints (adjust as needed for task size)
3. **FEATURE-BASED THINKING**: Align all code organization with vertical slices
4. **PERFORMANCE AWARE**: Every change should consider performance impact
5. **USER EXPERIENCE PRIORITY**: Prioritize usability over technical complexity
6. **MAINTAINABILITY**: Write code that can be easily understood and modified
7. **WINDOWS TERMINAL COMPATIBILITY**: Never use `&&` operators in terminal commands - use separate commands or Windows-compatible syntax

## 📋 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (START HERE)

### Phase 5: Enhanced User Experience (2-3 Hours) 🎯 NEXT PRIORITY
1. [ ] **Hour 1**: Improve responsive design for mobile devices (e.g., for Quiz, Tips, Analytics pages on smaller screens).
2. [ ] **Hour 2**: Add better loading states and error boundaries throughout the React application.
3. [ ] **Hour 3**: Enhance accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) for key interactive elements.
4. [ ] Add export functionality for analytics data (e.g., to CSV).

### After That: Final Polish & Testing
1. [ ] Comprehensive testing of all features
2. [ ] Performance testing and optimization
3. [ ] Final Azure deployment and testing
4. [ ] Documentation finalization
